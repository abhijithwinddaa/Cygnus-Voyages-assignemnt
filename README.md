## Deployment

This project can be deployed to:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) - Recommended for React apps
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com) - Easy deployment with drag & drop

## Assumptions

- Job data is static (mock data) - no backend/API integration required
- Location filter options are limited to "Remote" and "On-site"
- Job type filter options are "Internship" and "Full-time"
- Search is case-insensitive and matches job titles only

## Improvements with More Time

- **Backend Integration** - Connect to a real API for dynamic job listings
- **Pagination** - Add pagination or infinite scroll for large datasets
- **Advanced Filters** - Add salary range, experience level, and date posted filters
- **Save/Bookmark Jobs** - Allow users to save jobs for later (with localStorage)
- **Job Details Page** - Add a detailed view for each job with full description
- **Dark Mode** - Implement theme toggle for better accessibility
- **Unit Tests** - Add Jest/React Testing Library tests for components
- **TypeScript** - Add type safety for better code maintainability
